# How to add accounts?
Make the txt file in the Accounts folder. Thats it lol

# Py Gen
A website gen based on python, html and javascript. The backend of the site is made entirely with python, this makes it so that the database is not made public making it secure.

# Note
People can abuse this system by using proxies or clearing their session everytime they gen to bypass the cooldown. To fix this, you could make a login system or add recaptcha to the site. If you need help, message me on discord:
